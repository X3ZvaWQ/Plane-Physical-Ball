Gravity, friction, collisions and more

A very simple canvas program of javascript.   
No dependencies are required.

This program can help you familiarize yourself with how to make movement with canvas if you need.

Now this program can only simulate gravity and collisions.   
I think it can add more factors, like friction.

If there is anything you think you can improve, feel free to change it.

And the formula was used with incorrect parameters.   
If you can correct it, please.
